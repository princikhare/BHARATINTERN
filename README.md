 This repository contains 3 different projects of machine learning , using different algorithms of machine learning to serve the purpose of predictive modeling.
 <br>
 House Price Prediction:- creating Machine Learning Linear Regression Model and  analyzing a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters.doing Exploratory Data Analysis, spliting the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions.
 <br>
 Wine Quality Prediction:-For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to  predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality”

IRIS Flower Prediction:-This project focuses on the classification of different species of iris flowers using logistic regression. By considering the length of petals and sepals. The Jupyter notebook code provides comprehensive explanations of the data preprocessing, model training, and classification process.

All three projects are designed to demonstrate the application of regression in specific domains, showcasing how it can be used effectively for prediction tasks. By exploring the provided Jupyter notebook code, users can gain a deeper understanding of the implementation details and potentially apply similar techniques to their own projects.
